  <h3>WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT US</h3>
<div class="text">"From check in to check out, the staff is fantastic. At check in they gave us great information on local restaurants and things happening at the resort for the week. The in house restaurant staff is very accommodating and nice. A breath of fresh air to most places we have been. The outside pool service is great for food and drinks. We used this almost everyday for lunch. The beach at this resort is fantastic as well. At low tide you can see all sorts of things from starfish, crabs, shells, sand dollars, etc. We even found three horseshoe crabs in the tide pools at low tide. We will definitely vacation here again."
